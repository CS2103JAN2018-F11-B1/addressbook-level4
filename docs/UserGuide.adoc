== Introduction

CRM Book application aims to assist salespeople in managing the information of leads and contacts
more optimally for future sales decisions.
Unique features of this application include identifying if a Lead to be added in is a duplicate,
scheduling appointments with Leads through the Calander, converting a Lead to a Contact after a sales transaction, and integrating LinkedIn to allow
a salesperson to know if one of their contacts changed companies.
*More importantly, CRM Book is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast,
CRM Book can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
